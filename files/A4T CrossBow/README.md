# Dragon Rapido UHF Cowling Resessed for Crossbow Cutter
### By [WoodWorker]
Simple modification to the Dragon Rapido UHF cowling to drop teh CrossBow cutter into the spacer on top of the toolhead.    Only set for the WW-BMG hole spacing and the XOL carraige.   

Tested wtih the Dragon Ace Volcano + MZE hotend and 3mm spacer between hotend and cowling mount.

###BOM
Will require 4 M2.5 x 10, or M2.5 x 12 flat head screws to mount hotend
