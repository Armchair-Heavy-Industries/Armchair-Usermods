# 3MF Files

### MeowXol Faceplate v4

The faceplate has a built in support behind the paw to help with printability. 3MF files were used so the support could be removed without having to create a separate file or open the cad.

Recommend printing parts with arachne or a small nozzle for best results.

The XolPAP spacer moves the faceplate out slightly so it clears the XolPAP ducts.
