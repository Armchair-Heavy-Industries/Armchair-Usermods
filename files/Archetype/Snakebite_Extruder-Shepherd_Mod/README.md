# Snakebite
Stemming from the sleek package Takti introduced as the Shepherd extruder for Archetype, Snakebite lowers the extruder drivetrain by 1.5mm. The secondary filament drive gear has been replaced by a 683 / MR73 bearing in an attempt to combat the well known [Issue 6](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner/issues/6), prevelant on most direct feed extruders.
