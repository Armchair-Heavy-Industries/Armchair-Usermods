# Archetype Rail Carriage Clamp Mod

https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Archetype

A User Mod to the Armchair Heavy Industries Archetype Rail Carriage mount to clamp belts directly to the Rail mounts as well as providing a excess belt loop location

Works with 6mm & 9mm belts

Voron Stock Belt Path 

	-MGN9H
	-MGN12H


Monolith Belt Path

	-MGN9H
	-MGN12H
	-MGN12H IDEX


This replaces the universal belt clip with belt clamps that restrain the belt directly to the rail carriage itself as well as providing a excess belt loop location

I personally found that the stock belt mount lacked the ability to adjusting individual belt slack as well as ensure that belt pretension slack for mods like Monolith, which has very limited tension range

During testing this style of belt clamp was tested up to 40kg of weight hanging from the belts with no slip occuring with the test rail carriage mount plastic failing during a shock loading of that 40kg before any belt slip was obeserved.

The current version only supports MGN12H but this may expand to MGN9H in the future

BOM:
6  M2  3mm x 3.6mm x 3.6mm heat sets
4  M2x 12mm SHCS
2  M2x 8mm  SHCS
2  M3x 45mm smooth pin or M3X45 SHCS  <- Smooth pins are prefered and you should have them from the stock build of Archetype

Print settings:
Recommend 6/6/6 with >80% infill 
ABS as a minimum with anything better if possible
Classic slicer with 0.4mm nozzle

Assembly:

First Side
-Place the belts into the recease and push the pin through from the top and feed the belt back over itself
-Tighten the 3 M2 bolts evenly, you only need to tighen them just enough to restrain the belt in place, deforming the belt clamp is a sign its too much.

Last side
-Place the belts into the recess and push the pin through from the top and feed the belt back over itself
-lightly tighten this sides set of m3 bolts where it just grabs the belt
-At this stage its possible to take the slack out of the belts and slighlty preload them, ensure you do not rack your gantry while doing this!
-Once a suitible amount of preloading is applied, tighten as the previous side

-Feed the excess belt back through the clamp to ensure a tidy setup

Make sure to recheck belt tension
