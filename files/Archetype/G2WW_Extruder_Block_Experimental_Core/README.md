# Galileo 2 Wristwatch extruder block for Experimental Core
[by axg20202]

A flat extruder block to mount the Galileo 2 Wristwatch extruder (or similar) to the Experimental Core (see Experimental Git branch). Updated (April 2025) following the release of interim Experimental CAD to improve duct clearances for printed and SLM parts.  

A new version of the G2 wristwatch front is included - the only change here is the position of the additional front securing tab and screw hole. 

Thanks to tetsu97 for creating the G2WW https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder
